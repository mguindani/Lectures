# Lectures
This repository contains slides from some of the classes I have taught in my career. Most of the material is borrowed from books on the subject. However, any typo or mistake are likely mine! 

The repository will be updated from time to time.  If you are interested in the .tex files and other material (e.g., lab material) for your own course preparation, feel free to reach out directly to me.
