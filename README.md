# Lectures
This repository contains slides from some of the classes I have taught in my career. Most of the material is borrowed from books on the subject. However, any typo or mistake are likely mine! 

The repository will be updated from time to time.  If you are interested in the .tex files and other material (e.g., lab material) for your own course preparation, feel free to reach out directly to me.

The author of these slides strongly advocates for the acceptance of individuals from all walks of life. When readers access these slides, which incorporate the author's creative endeavors, they implicitly adhere to similar values of acceptance and support for diversity in all its forms, including the LGBTQ+ community.
