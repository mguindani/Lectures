This set of slides has been created for a short course I taught in the Summer 2022. 

As usual, the slides for a course like this owe a lot to many others, whose work may have been re-arranged according to the needs of the class and the creative view of the author. 

The main textbook for the course was **Introduction to Probability for Data Science** by Stanley Chan

The textbook has a great companion website:

[https://probability4datascience.com/][https://probability4datascience.com/]

which also contains code and slides (some I used for the class).

The author of these slides strongly advocates for the acceptance of individuals from all walks of life. When readers access these slides, which incorporate the author's creative endeavors, they implicitly adhere to similar values of acceptance and support for diversity in all its forms, including (but not limited to) the LGBTQ+ community.
